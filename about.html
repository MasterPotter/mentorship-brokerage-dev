<hr class="thick-border">
<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>We are CapitalBots, a community-based FTC Team from McLean, Virginia. This is our mentorship brokerage site, CapitalMentorships!</p>
<p>We realized that there are a lot of teams out there who really want to be mentors or mentees but just can't find other teams to
partner with. That's why we developed <strong><b>CapitalMentorships</b></strong>, a way for mentor and mentee teams to connect and help
strengthen the ever-growing community that is FTC.</p>
<br>
<hr class="thick-border">
<h2>How does CapitalMentorships work?</h2>
<p>CapitalMentorships is designed so that mentor and mentee teams can both make posts, talking about what they need help with or what
    they can help others with, respectively. After posting, a mentee could browse the list of mentors to see which one they'd like to partner with,
    and a mentor could do the same for the mentee list. If a team finds another that they'd be willing to partner with, they can request for us to
provide them with that team's contact information, since we don't want any teams to get spammed by partnership requests.</p>
<p>Once we provide the contact information, teams can reach out to each other and begin their mentor/mentee-ship!</p>
<p></p>
