This is my code for a test version of a mentorship brokerage program idea that I had for robotics, where both mentor teams and mentee teams can sign up for different types of mentoring (virtual/in person, 
long-term/short-term, build, programming,outreach mentoring, fundraising mentoring, or anything else) and this algorithm will match your team with a team who you can help or who can help you!
